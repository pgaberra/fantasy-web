 * Every route is loaded on demand. Statically importing the components put each feature —
 * the projections table, the draft board, Who's hot, the shared page — into the initial
 * bundle, which was closing in on the 1 MB `maximumError` budget in `angular.json`. The
 * guards stay eagerly imported: they are tiny and have to run before the chunk is fetched.
 *
 * `data: { [INDEXABLE]: true }` is what lets search engines list a page; every route without it
 * is marked noindex (see shared/crawl-tags.ts), and public/sitemap.xml has to list exactly the
 * ones with it. An indexable page other than the home page also needs a `title` and a
 * `data: { [DESCRIPTION]: … }` of its own and a prerender in app.routes.server.ts: Google folds a
 * page that answers with the home page's title into the home page (crawl-rules.spec.ts checks).

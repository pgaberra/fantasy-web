 * An icon from the Lucide set, drawn by ng-icon: a 24x24 grid, `currentColor`, no fill, stroke

 *
 * One set is the point. The app's icons were once drawn by hand in each template, 61 inline SVGs
 * with six stroke widths and three icon families mixed, refresh drawn three ways. Collecting them
 * into hand-copied drawings in one file fixed the drift but left every new icon to be copied by
 * hand as well; sourcing them from the package means the drawing is Lucide's own every time.
 *
 * Only the size is settable, and only to a step on the scale (`IconSize`): a number is pixels, and an
 * `em` length such as `0.85em` lets an icon scale with the text around it. Colour comes from the
 * surrounding text, so an icon follows hover, disabled and danger states without being told.
 * Icons are `aria-hidden`: the accessible name belongs on the button or link around them.
 *
 * Brand marks (Yahoo, Google, Facebook) are not icons and are not here. They are multi-colour
 * logos at their owners' own scales. `.github/scripts/check-inline-icons.sh` allows those files an
 * inline `<svg>`, and fails the build on any other, and on a character typed where an icon belongs.
